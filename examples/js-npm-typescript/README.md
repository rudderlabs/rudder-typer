> Note: If you are building your own sample app, `@rudderstack/analytics-js` npm package must be added as a dev dependency of the package.json.

## Regenerate client libraries

Run the command `npx rudder-typer`. This will generate new `index.ts` file based on the ruddertyper.yml.

### Production RudderTyper

Run the following command to regenerate the client library based on your tracking plan using the production version of RudderType in NPM:

```
npx rudder-typer init
```

You can further execute various RudderTyper commands like,

```
npx rudder-typer <command>
```

### Development RudderTyper

Execute the following steps to regenerate the client library based on your tracking plan using the RudderType module from the local repository:

Note: Ensure that you have setup the repository for development.

```
npm run rudder-typer:dev init
```

This will build the RudderTyper module locally and regenerates the client library based on the tracking plan.

You can further execute various RudderTyper commands like,

```
npm run rudder-typer:dev <command>
```
