## Brief overview

Architecture overview for the code generation system, detailing how Plan, Context, Platform, Namer, and Template components work together to generate type-safe analytics bindings.

## Component responsibilities

- Plan: Describes the structure of analytics events and their properties, directly related to the tracking plan and Data Catalog definitions.

  - Contains event rules with type and structure information
  - Defines property schemas including types and validation rules
  - Supports nested object structures with unlimited depth

- Context: Intermediary data structure between Plan and Template

  - Provides a clean, processed view of the data needed for code generation
  - Separates template concerns from business logic
  - Types and functions are organized separately for clarity

- Platform: Orchestrates the code generation process

  - Transforms Plan into language-specific Context
  - Handles file generation and template rendering
  - Extensible for multiple programming languages
  - Each platform implementation defines its own Context type

- Namer: Manages identifier generation

  - Base class provides common functionality
  - Language-specific implementations handle unique requirements
  - Ensures generated names are valid and collision-free
  - Maintains scope separation for different name types

- Template: Defines the output format using Handlebars
  - Receives Context data for rendering
  - Maintains consistent code formatting
  - Keeps presentation logic separate from generation logic

## Data flow

- Plan -> Platform processes into Context
- Context enhanced by Namer for valid identifiers
- Template renders Context into final code
- Each step maintains clear separation of concerns

## Extension strategy

- New languages implemented as Platform subclasses
- Each platform defines:
  - Language-specific Context structure
  - Appropriate Namer implementation
  - Handlebars templates for code generation
  - Any necessary helper functions

## Design principles

- Separation of concerns between data (Plan), processing (Platform), and presentation (Template)
- Clear interfaces between components for maintainability
- Strong typing throughout the generation pipeline
- Extensibility for new languages without core changes
